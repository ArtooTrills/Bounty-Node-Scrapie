Bounty-Node-Scrapie
===================

As you may know we work with Financial Instutions who go to great lengths to find out as much information as possible about their prospective customer to reduce their risk. They go to Credit Bureaus ask enquire with customer details to see if any customer has ever defaulted before. The bureaus are central organizations that can trace any loan you have ever taken and if you have defaulted (not paid the required amount), when did you default and how much is that amount. 

We are working with one such government entity. Like good legacy systems, there are no APIs -- at least not for a tiny fish like Artoo. We need to scrap data of their website and create a JSON object that we can internally consume. Look at the sample htm pages. (Note: We have modified data to anonymize the individual).

Using CoffeeScript Nodejs and Phantom, create a function which will receive the url as an argument:

```
  scrapie = (url) ->
  	 

     json

```
